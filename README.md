# 3D View Synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields

Implementation of 3D View Synthesis using classical Volumetric Rendering and Ray Sampling. This implementation is based on the paper [Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis
](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) by `Mildenhall et al.`
In this implementation, we experimented by using both `Tensorflow` and `Pytorch` for experimentation and implementation.
The final training was carried out on `Carbonate-DL` and `Carbonate-GPU` and the tensorflow code was used.

### About the Project

Neural volume rendering refers to methods that generate images or video by tracing a ray into the scene and taking an integral of some sort over the length of the ray.
